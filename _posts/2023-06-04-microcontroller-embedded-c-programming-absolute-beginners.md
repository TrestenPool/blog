# Udemy Microcontroller Embedded C Programming Tutorial Notes

### I asked ChatGPT to write me a curriculium to learn embedded systems.
1. Basics of Embedded Systems:
- Understand the fundamentals of embedded systems, including hardware-software interaction, real-time constraints, and resource limitations.Study microcontroller architecture, digital logic, and basic electronics.


2. C Programming Language:
- Refresh your knowledge of the C programming language, as it is widely used in embedded systems development. Focus on low-level programming concepts, memory management, bitwise operations, and working with registers and pointers.

3. Embedded Systems Development Tools:
- Familiarize yourself with the tools commonly used in embedded systems development, such as IDEs, compilers, debuggers, and emulators. Learn to set up and configure development boards and microcontrollers for programming.

4. Microcontroller Architecture:
- Deep dive into microcontroller architectures, such as ARM Cortex-M series or PIC, and understand their features, peripherals, and memory organization. Study the datasheets and reference manuals provided by the microcontroller manufacturers.

5. Embedded Systems Programming:
- Explore topics like digital I/O, timers, interrupts, analog-to-digital conversion, and serial communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C). Learn how to interface with sensors, actuators, and other external devices.

6. RTOS and Real-Time Programming:
- Gain an understanding of real-time operating systems (RTOS) and their concepts like task scheduling, synchronization, and inter-process communication. Learn to develop multi-threaded applications for embedded systems.

7. Embedded Systems Software Design:
- Study software design principles for embedded systems, including modular programming, code reuse, and software architectures. Explore design patterns specific to embedded systems.

8. Embedded Systems Testing and Debugging:
- Learn various testing and debugging techniques specific to embedded systems, such as using in-circuit emulators, logic analyzers, and oscilloscopes. Understand how to troubleshoot hardware and software issues.

9. Low-Level Hardware Interfacing:
- Dive into low-level hardware interfacing techniques, including direct register access, device drivers, and peripheral programming. Explore topics like DMA (Direct Memory Access) and interrupt handling.

10. Embedded Systems Projects:
- Undertake hands-on projects to apply your knowledge and gain practical experience. Develop projects that involve sensor interfacing, motor control, communication protocols, or any specific area of interest within embedded systems.

11. Industry Standards and Best Practices:
- Stay updated on industry standards, protocols, and best practices related to embedded systems development. Follow blogs, forums, and relevant publications to stay abreast of the latest advancements in the field.
